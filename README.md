Welcome to the MERN Stack Mono-Repo Project! This project utilizes the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack to create a full-stack web application for managing bureaus. Below you'll find a detailed overview of the project structure, technologies used, and features implemented.

## Project Structure

```
MERN-STACK-SAMPLE/
├── client
│   └── frontend stuff
└── server
    └── backend stuff
```

- **[client](./client/README.md)**: Contains frontend code written in React.js.
- **[server](./server/README.md)**: Contains backend code written in Node.js using Express.js with Mongo DB.

## Detailed Description

The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for building modern web applications. It comprises four main technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side.

Additionally, Mongoose is used with MongoDB to provide a schema-based solution to model application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, and business logic hooks.
